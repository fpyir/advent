# advent
This repository contains all of my work through every challenge of Advent of Code - 2015 to 2020.

I'll be completing every single year in four languages - JS (Node), Python (3.8), Go & Java.
Within each language I will be writing the code as idiomatic as possible. In some scenarios I might offer two solutions in the same language - one focused on performance, one focused on maintainability. Of course, all other times I'll be trying to optimise for both.
